# Processing for Generative Design

This is a book about the practice of Generative Design with a software called [Processing](https://processing.org/). Processing is programming language for designers an artists. In the book I am explaining how graphic designers can make the transition to generative design.

The book is in an early stage and underlies an iterative process of writing.

You can read the book on GitBook:
