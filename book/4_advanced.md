# Advanced Drawing

## About this chapter

In the previous chapter we looked into the basic drawing capabilities of Processing. You probably know how to bring shapes to the screen in general but you are interested in how to make these drawings dynamic. Before we get to the benefit of programming design, I want to get some things out of the way.

## File Handling

Before we keep advancing in the topic of drawing in Processing, I want to address a general topic: Saving your sketch. I am pretty sure, that you are familiar with the basics of saving a file locally. Either you use ```File > Save``` in the Editor or you press ```Ctrl + s``` or ```Cmd + s``` respectively.

Processing will now save your code as a text file with a ```.pde``` suffix inside a folder that has the exact name as your sketch. This minimal footprint enables you maximum portability. You can send this file to anyone with an installation of Processing.

Later, we will add more files and folders to this directory, but the idea stays the same.

Parenthetically mentioned, Processing excellently works inside a git-based work flow.

## The most basic interaction: Mouse movement

Generally interactions take some time and practice to be programmed. Interactions have to be precise and well defined in order to serve your purpose.

There is one interaction though that is so use to use, you almost do not have to rewrite any of the code from the last chapter to make it dynamic.
