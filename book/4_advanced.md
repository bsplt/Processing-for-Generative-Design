# Advanced Drawing

## About this chapter

In the previous chapter we looked into the basic drawing capabilities of Processing. You are probably reading the book because you as a designer already know how to bring shapes to the screen but want to know how you can make things dynamic. Before we get into the big value of programming, I want to get some things out of the way.

I will give you a slight hint of the capabilities of Processing pretty soon with `mouseX` and `mouseY` but then we ware back to drawing for a while.
