# About the Book

## Disclaimer

This guide is still in an early stage of writing. I try to incorporate as many insights from my teaching as possible. The book will undergo different iterations in the future until everyone feels happy about it. Please feel free to reach out to me for critique or suggestions.

## What is this guide about?

If you have a strong background in graphic design practice and want to learn the basic technical skills behind generative design, this guide might address you. People have come up with a lot of incoherent definitions of generative design, but this guide focuses on a perspective inherited from early algorithmic art and progressive thinkers in graphic design, as a distinction from less open approaches that we can find in industrial design and architecture. I write this guide as a practice as well as assistance for my students because I never found a guide that could support in my courses.

## What is the goal of the book?

With this book I am trying to build a transition from graphic design to generative design for design students and curious designers. In my eyes a lot is wrong with the current state of the design software industry. I want young and ambitious designers to have another perspective on their everyday practice and the ability to build their own tools if they are in need to. I have a loveâ€“hate relationship with Adobe.
