# About Generative Design

## What is Generative Design?

In generative design we build tools that do work we could have done as designers, but probably wouldn't have because it is too tedious. Imagine copy-pasting a graphic 1000 times and always changing it a little bit.

We use the immense power of computers to repeat operations very quickly combined with our creative ability to predict what might look good in order to create a broad variety of designs, that we could not have done on our own.

We can use generative design to create unlimited suggestions of designs from which we can choose or we can even completely leave the design working on its own. Generative design is the radical parameterization of a work with values, which are set by something else than us.

Imagine you would build a design in a graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator, but instead of using fixed values for everything from positions over colors to layouts, you use parameters that are determined by randomness or data like the weather or your heart rate. Every time you would save a new new copy of your design it would look different. The concept behind your work would still be the same, but you have now more than one fixed manifestation.

## A New Frontier for Digital Design

Computation is only the technical core of generative design. We help digital design to reach the height of its existence. Generative design is not about programming, it is about aesthetics that are only possible through programming.

Most of the tools we use in Photoshop and Illustrator, to pick an example, are inherited from pre-digital practices like developing film in darkrooms or drawing and cutting with paper. By sticking only to these tools digitally we miss a great opportunity in the form of aesthetics that are only able to emerge from digital-only practices.
