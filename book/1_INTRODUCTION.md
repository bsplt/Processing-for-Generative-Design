# Processing for Generative Design

This guide is still in an early stage of writing.

## What is this guide about?

If you have a strong background in graphic design practice and want to learn the basic technical skills behind generative design, this guide might address you. People have come up with a lot of incoherent definitions of generative design, but this guide focuses on a perspective inherited from early algorithmic art  and progressive thinkers in graphic design, as a distinction from less open approaches that we can find in industrial design and architecture. I write this guide as a practice as well as assistance for my students because I never found a guide that could support in my courses.

## What is Generative Design?

In generative design we build tools that do the work the we could have done as designers, but probably wouldn't have because our lifetime is limited. We use the immense power of computers to repeat operations very quickly combined with our creative ability to predict what the elements of a good design are in order to create a broad variety of designs, that we could not have done on our own. We can use generative design to create unlimited suggestions of designs from which we can choose or we can even completely leave the design working on its own. Generative design is the radical parameterization of a work  with values, which are set by something else than us.

Imagine you would build a design in illustrator, but instead of using fixed values for everything from positions over colors to layouts, you use parameters that are determined by randomness or data like the weather or your heart rate. Every time you would save a new new copy of your design it would look different, but the conceptual idea behind it would still be the same.
